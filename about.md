<!-- ## What is CocoaHeads? -->

[CocoaHeads](http://www.cocoaheads.org) is a group devoted to discussion of Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch Frameworks for programming on MacOS X and iOS. During monthly meetings, members present on their projects and offer tutorials on various programming topics.

## History

CocoaHeads Belgium is the first and only (as far as we know) chapter of CocoaHeads in Belgium. Our very first meeting took place in Gent on 28 September 2009.


## Registration

The meeting is free for everyone interested in iOS and OS X development. We kindly ask you to register for the event on the Eventbrite page because spaces are usually limited.
