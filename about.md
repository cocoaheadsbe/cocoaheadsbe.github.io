<!-- ## What is CocoaHeads? -->

[CocoaHeads](http://www.cocoaheads.org) is a group devoted to discussion of Apple's frameworks and tools for programming on macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS. During our meetings, members present on their projects and offer tutorials on various programming topics.

## History

CocoaHeads Belgium is the first and only (as far as we know) chapter of CocoaHeads in Belgium. Our very first meeting took place in Gent on 28 September 2009.


## Registration

The meeting is free for everyone interested in developing for Apple's platforms. We kindly ask you to register for the events on the Eventbrite page because spaces are usually limited. See you soon!
