CocoaHeads is a group devoted to discussion of Apple Computer&#8217;s Cocoa Framework for programming on MacOS X (including the iPhone). 

This month the meeting will take place in Mons on the 26th of April. Raphael and Sandrine from [Creaceed][1] have been kind enough to provide us with a location in which we can hold this month&#8217;s meeting. The location for this month&#8217;s meeting is La Maison de l&#8217;Entreprise (LME), Parc Scientifique Initialis, 2 Rue Descartes, 7000 Mons. Raphael will be presenting a session on &#8220;XCode, Basics and Beyond&#8221;, which should be quite interesting for even the novice and more advanced developers in the community.

The meeting will start at 20:00, and there will be plenty of time to meet up with other Cocoa Heads BE enthousiasts. So if you&#8217;re interested, feel free to go to the EventBrite website and sign up, since spaces are limited.

You can find more information on CocoaHeads Belgium a the [CocoaHeads Belgium][2] website, in the [CocoaHeads Google Groups][3] and I even created a [Linked In group for CocoaHeads Belgium][4].

Registration for this Meeting can be done on the [Eventbrite page][5]. If you have suggestions for future sessions or are willing to give a session, that would be the perfect time to let us know.
