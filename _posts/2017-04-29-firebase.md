On May 16th, [Warren Gavin](https://twitter.com/Apokrupto) is going to tell us all about Firebase.

**Place and time**  
Binnenfort Fort 5  
Vestinglaan 55  
2650 Edegem  
8pm   

**Tickets**  
Please let us know if you are coming by reserving a ticket [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cocoaheads-belgium-may-2017-tickets-33903528366).

**Info**
The fort is located in a park. There are two parking lots outside the park, a small one at the main entrance and a larger one at the side entrance near the church. See map. The park entrances close at 21:00, but you can get out at any time.

You can follow the "Bolwerk" signs to find the fort entrance. Once you're through the gate (photo), go right, then immediately left, take the stairs up and go left again to enter the co-working space.
