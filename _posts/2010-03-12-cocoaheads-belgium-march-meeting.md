CocoaHeads is a group devoted to discussion of Apple Computer&#8217;s Cocoa Framework for programming on MacOS X (including the iPhone). 

This month the meeting will take place in Leuven on the 22nd March, and will be focused on all things OpenGL. The location for this month&#8217;s meeting is Diestsevest 39, 3000 Leuven. The venue is within walking distance of the Railway Station, and close to the Parking lot under the Martelarenplein.

Thanks to Stephane Winnepenninckx we will have a special guest speaker again this month : Jay Martin Anderson. Jay is the OpenGL instructor at The Big Nerd Ranch and has done computer graphics for over 45 years, and has developed graphics applications for Hewlett-Packard and the former Tymlabs Corporation.

Jay has lectured widely in the United States and Europe, especially on visualization with QuickTime movies. He is an Apple Distinguished Educator (class of 2001), and professor (emeritus) of computer science at Franklin & Marshall College, Lancaster PA, USA.

The meeting will start at 20:00, and there will be plenty of time to meet up with other Cocoa Heads BE enthousiasts. So if you&#8217;re interested, feel free to go to the EventBrite website and sign up, since spaces are limited.

You can find more information on CocoaHeads Belgium a the [CocoaHeads Belgium][1] website, in the [CocoaHeads Google Groups][2] and I even created a [Linked In group for CocoaHeads Belgium][3].

Registration for this Meeting can be done on the [Eventbrite page][4]. If you have suggestions for future sessions or are willing to give a session, that would be the perfect time to let us know.
