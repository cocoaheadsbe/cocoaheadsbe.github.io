CocoaHeads is a group devoted to discussion of Apple Computer&#8217;s Cocoa Framework for programming on MacOS X (including the iPhone). 

It took us a while to get this month&#8217;s event up and running &#8230; We had to search for an alternative location and that wasn&#8217;t the easiest task. We did finally find a location where we can rent a room which can host a maximum of 50 people on monday the 22nd of February. It&#8217;s located in the heart of Ghent, so it should be pretty easy to find a pub for some drinks after the meeting. The meeting will take place in the [Kapittelhuis][1], Lange Kruisstraat 4, 9000 Gent (Belgium)

We are still looking for someone who could bring a projector along, since there is none available at the location (there is a projection screen, but no projector). If you&#8217;re coming to this meeting and you could bring a projector, please get in touch with us.

This second meeting of 2010 will be a special meeting with no technical session. The goal of this meeting is to get to know each-other. Who are your fellow CocoaHeads Belgium colleagues, what are they doing, what are they working on, which apps have they created (Mac or iPhone). For that reason everyone will get the opportunity to present himself in a maximum of 5 minutes and tell us what you&#8217;re doing with Cocoa / CocoaTouch.

I think we can fit about 15-20 people in one session so if we get more we could spread it over 2 meetings. If you are interested in that, please let us know so we can schedule you for the next meeting.

This meeting is a great opportunity to meet up with other Cocoa Heads BE enthousiasts. The schedule for this meeting looks as follows :

  * 08:00 PM : As requested during the previous meeting, we have moved the starting time to 8 PM in order for everyone to get here.
  * 08:15 PM : Get to know each-other session.
  * 09:30 PM : Wrap-up, maybe go grab a beer.

You can find more information on CocoaHeads Belgium a the [CocoaHeads Belgium][2] website, in the [CocoaHeads Google Groups][3] and I even created a [Linked In group for CocoaHeads Belgium][4].

Registration for this Meeting can be done on the [Eventbrite page][5]. If you have suggestions for future sessions or are willing to give a session, that would be the perfect time to let us know.
