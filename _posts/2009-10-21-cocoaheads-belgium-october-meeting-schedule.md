The October meeting will take place in Gent on wednesday the 28 th of October. This meeting is a great opportunity to meet up with other Cocoa Heads BE enthousiasts. Thanks to the people at [IBBT][1] we are able to host the meeting at their venue again ! The schedule for this meeting looks as follows : 

  * 08:00 PM : As requested during the previous meeting, we have moved the starting time to 8 PM in order for everyone to get here.
  * 08:15 PM : CocoaHeads Belgium Status up date (What has been done so far, what still needs to be done, and how can you help). This shouldn&#8217;t take a lot longer than 15 minutes, but we did plan half an hour just in case.
  * 08:45 PM : Stephane Winnepenninckx has prepared a session about the iPhone Bootcamp courses at The Big Nerd Ranch. During his session he will tell us everything we need to know about the iPhone Bootcamp and lots more. 
  * 09:30 PM : Feedback. Well if there is still some time it would be a good idea to hear what the CocoaHeads BE community think of our efforts so far.

Feel free to check out this website, the [CocoaHeads Belgium Google Groups][2] and the [Linked In group for CocoaHeads Belgium][3]. 

Registration for the October Meeting can be done on the [Eventbrite page][4]. If you have suggestions for future sessions or are willing to give a session, that would be the perfect time to let us know. 

Regards,
