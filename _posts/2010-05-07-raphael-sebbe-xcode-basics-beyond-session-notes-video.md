#### Meeting &#8211; Notes

Well, I would like to thank [Raphael Sebbe][1] and [Sandrine Louiseau][2] from [Creaceed][3] once more for allowing us to use the room for our Cocoaheads Belgium meeting.

The room was filled once again, and I think we had approximately 20 people joining us this time (and about 8 iPads I believe). Of course all the familiar faces were there again, and we also had some newcomers there too.

This month [Raphael Sebbe][1] prepared a session about XCode for us. Raphael is a developer from [Creaceed][3] who are the creators of some Mac and iPhone products like Prizmo, Hydra and Vocalia. And Raphael showed us how he is using XCode for a few things, learned us some new keyboard shortcuts and showed us a few Tips and Tricks. All in all, it was a great session both for beginners like me and more advanced XCode users.

[Cocoaheads Belgium &#8211; Raphael Sebbe &#8211; XCode : Basics & Beyond &#8211; April 2010][4] from [Stefaan Lesage][5] on [Vimeo][6].

You can find a [PDF version of the actual presentation][7] on the Creaceed website.

##### Status Update

Before the session started I gave a little Status Update on things we have already done since the last meeting. As we all know by now, we have our [Google Group for CocoaHeadsBE][8] and [CocoaHeadsBE group on LinkedIn][9], and of course our CocoaHeads Belgium webiste / Blog. Furthermore you can also follow the [CocoaheadsBE][10] twitter account to learn more about us.

I would like to encourage everyone to help us fill it with content you guys are looking for. A great example here is the Book Reviews like the ones posted by [Spencer Pieters][11]. The more content we have, the more visitors the website will generate, and the easier it will be for Cocoaheads Belgium to achieve some things.

If you have a Cocoa Problem, feel free to post it in our Google Group &#8230; if you have an interesting tutorial to share you can always post it on the CocoaHeads Belgium website. Even if you post it on your own website, we would appreciate a little post on the CocoaHeads Belgium website which links through to your website for the full content.

##### Next Meeting

We decided that the next meeting will be on monday, the 31st of May. Currently we are still looking for a room we could use to hold the meeting, and also for someone to hold an actual session on something.

So, if you do know of a location we could use, or are willing to present something related to Mac / iPhone or iPad development, please get in touch with us.

#### Final Note

If anyone thinks he can help us out with one of the ideas mentioned in this topic, please do contact us. If you still have more ideas &#8230; well contact us as well. There is a real need for a CocoaHeads Belgium, and I&#8217;m sure that we can make it happen if we all work on it together.

Regards,

Stefaan
