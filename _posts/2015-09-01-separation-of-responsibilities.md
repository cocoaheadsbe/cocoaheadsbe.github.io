Warren Gavin will talk about using separation by behaviour to reduce view controller responsibilities, code size and repetition.

We'll discuss the 'behaviours' methodology used to separate individual responsibilities into common code that can be used and reused across multiple projects with very little customisation, speeding up development time and resulting in fewer lines of code that needs to be debugged.
