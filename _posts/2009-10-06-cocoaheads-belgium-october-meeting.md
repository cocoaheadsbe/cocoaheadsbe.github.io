Last month we had a great turnout on our [CocoaHeads Belgium Founding Meeting][1], and plans are being made for the first real meeting this month.

Thanks to the people at [IBBT][2] we are able to host the meeting at their venue again !

The date will be picked based on the feedback we get form the [Doodle][3] we set up earlier today. If you are interested in joining us, please help us pick a date using the [Doodle Poll][3].

We are looking for some people who are willing to give a Session on a topic related to Mac or iPhone development. If you are willing to give a session, please let us know. You can post a comment on this post or use our [Google Group][4] to let us know about the session your are willing to give. Sessions can be Technical or non Technical as long as they are related to Cocoa Development.

We will keep the website updated with the Program for the October meeting.

We are hoping to have a lot of attendees and some interesting sessions to give at the October Meeting. Looking forward to see you all back again.

Regards,

Stefaan
