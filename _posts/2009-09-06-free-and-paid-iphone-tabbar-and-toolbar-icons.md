title: Free and Paid iPhone TabBar and ToolBar Icons
author: Stefaan Lesage
excerpt: "A while back, I was looking for some Icons I could use in a TabBar and ToolBar for a little iPhone project I was working on.  Since I'm more of a programmer than a designer, I decided to have a look around the internet to see if I could find anything that suits my needs ..."

#### Free

Some generous folks are providing icons free of charge, so I decided I would start with 2 free Icons sets

##### Glyphish : 120 great icons for great apps

My initial search drove me to the [Icons for your iPhone apps][1] project on Kickstarter. The icons by [Joseph Wain][2] looked awesome, so I decided to back the project. If he could raise $500 in donations the icons would be released for use in any application !

Meanwhile his set of 120 beautifully designed iconst for iPhone applications is available on the [Glyphish website][3]. The Icons are designed and optimised for use on toolbars and tab bars, but they can also be used in other applications, websitesa and lots more.

What&#8217;s even better is that the icons by [Joseph Wain][4] are shared under the [Creative Commons Attribution][5] License.

If you use his icons in your next kille iPhone application, make sure to send him a message about it. Some of the applications which use his icons are :

  * [Groceries 2.0 by Syphiestication][6]
  * [Birdbrain][7]
  * [Harvest][8] by Sean Murphy
  * [iGrarageSale][9] by Performant Design
  * and lots more &#8230;

##### PixelPress : Free iPhone Toolbar Icons

Another great iPhone Icons set is the one created by the folks at [PixelPress][10]. Again a comprehensive set of 50 icons which can be used in your Toolbars and NavBars. The set is available for anyone to use in any kind of iPhone applications (free or commercial) and are released under the [Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Canada license][11].  


<div style="width: 470px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

</div>

If you use these icons, make sure you send a note to the folks at PixelPress as well.

#### Paid

There are also a few great Icons sets which aren&#8217;t free, but still quite cheap ! I can&#8217;t imagine I would be able to create a similar set of icons for that price !

##### PixelPress : Whitespace Stock Icons for iPhone Developers

Back in July PixelPress released a [Big set of icons][12] which are available in the most popular iPhone toolbar and tab bar sizes : 30&#215;30 and 20&#215;30 pixels. The Icon collection is also avaiable in vector Photoshop PSD format for scaling and sizing to y our own needs. 

<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
  <a href="http://www.pixelpressicons.com/?page_id=118"><img alt="PixelPress WhiteSpace Stock Icons" src="http://www.pixelpressicons.com/images/V-30xpreview.png" title="PixelPress WhiteSpace Stock Icons" width="500" height="3588" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">

  </p>
</div>

Both collections include the icons in two tones: black and white both with alpha channel. The Icon set includes all of the basic icons you need, and many icons for niches like finance, GPS, multimedia and even gaming

The Icons set is priced at $69 for the Pixel collection and $175 for the Vector collection. What&#8217;s even better is that it includes updates made to the Icon set ! Back in August a new set of 25 icons was added to the collecting, and apparently a new update will be made this month !

If you ask me, $69 for a collection of 277 well designed icons is &#8230; well almost Free !

##### Eddit : Shop / iPhone UI Icon Set

Another set of icons is available on the Eddit website. Their [iPhone UI Icon Set][13] consists of 160 PNG icons in 2 sizes, plus 4 free ibkube servuce icons for a total price of $69

#### Closing Words

This is by no means a complete list of all Free and Paid icons available on the internet, but just a few of the Icons sets I found while looking for a few good icons. If you know of any other Icons sets which are worth mentioning, please add a comment to this post, and we will make sure they get included in the article.
