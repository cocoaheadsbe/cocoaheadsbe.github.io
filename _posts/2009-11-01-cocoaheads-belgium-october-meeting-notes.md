#### CocoaHeads Belgium October Meeting &#8211; Notes

First of all, I would like to thank all attendees for showing up. We had about 35 people from all over the country joining us on this Meeting. For those who couldn&#8217;t make it, or didn&#8217;t know about this initiative, no worries, we will be putting all information online anyway, and this time we even video taped the session !

##### Status Update

Before the session started I gave a little Status Update on things we have already done since the last meeting. 

As requested by the group, we have created a [Google Group for CocoaHeadsBE][1]. Some of you had indicated that it would be a lot easier to post things in a Google Group as opposed to posting it on the Website. Well, the Group is there, but apparently not everyone found it yet. Feel free to use the Google Group and post things in it if you want !

We also created a [CocoaHeadsBE group on LinkedIn][2]. We&#8217;re not quite sure what we will do with it, but for those of you who have an account on LinkedIn, make sure you join the group as well. It could be used in the future to post job openings and get in touch with each other on a professional level.

##### This month&#8217;s session : Stéphane Winnepenninckx : iPhone Bootcamp at The Big Nerd Ranch

This mont&#8217;s meeting was all about the iPhone Bootcamps at The Big Nerd Ranch (Europe). Stéphane Winnepenninckx from WiS & Co took the opportunity to share us his experiences with the [iPhone Bootcamp][3] at [The Big Nerd Ranch][4]. Thanks to Stephane we even had Stefanie Höfling from [The Big Nerd Ranch][5] joining in as well !

Stéphane covered everything you need to know in order to be prepared for the iPhone Bootcamp at BNR. It would be way too much to cover in an article, and since we video taped the session, I decided to put the video online for everyone to watch.

##### The Video

Well, the Session was video taped as a test. I&#8217;m not quite sure if we will keep doing that in the future. Personally I&#8217;m not 100% happy with the result. The video was shot in HD format, but in order to upload it to the interwebs I had to compress it a lot. It just wan&#8217;t affordable to upload the huge HD file since it would cost us way too much in bandwidth.

As I mentioned this was just a test, but if people are interested in those Video&#8217;s, we might continue video taping the sessions. If we can find the resources we might even add a second camera to the setup. Of course that would take us a bit longer to produce the final movie, but it would be a bit more dynamic to watch.

If you want us to keep video taping the sessions, please let me know. And if you have any suggestions on how to make the video even better, feel free to talk to me as well.

##### Next month&#8217;s meeting

After the session, I asked the attendees if it wouldn&#8217;t be better if we pick a fixed day in the month for the sessions. That would actually make everyone&#8217;s life a little easier and would allow us to plan things ahead. There was a consensus on having the meetings in the third of fourth week of the month, and on a monday or wednesday. I&#8217;ll be putting a new doodle online later this week in which everyone has the opportunity to vote for.

Additionally someone in the audience mentioned we could use their offices in Nijvel as well. Personally I don&#8217;t mind having the meetings take place once in Gent and once in Brussels as well. It would make it a bit easier for those who are located on the other side of the country to get there. If the person who suggested to use their offices is reading this, could you please get in touch with is so we can work something out ?

##### Ideas for Presentations :

It doesn&#8217;t matter where the next meeting will take place or on which day of the month it takes place, but one thing we will surely need is someone giving a presentation or a session on something related to Cocoa Development. If you have any ideas, or are willing to give a session at next month&#8217;s meeting, please get in touch with us so we can arrange everything.

Sessions could be anything, ranging from How to market / promote your application to how to design a good Mac / iPhone User Interface or even something technical like an in-depth look at Instruments. I had someone talk to me about presenting the &#8216;Bug of the Month&#8217;, in which he could give a short session about a typical problem he encountered while programming and how he solved it. All great topics for sessions !

So if you&#8217;re willing to give a presentation / session at the next CocoaHeads Belgium meeting, please let us know !

#### Final Note

I noticed we had less attendees this time, but I also noticed we had quite a few new faces joining in as well. This is great, since it a clear sign that there is interest in this initiative and that the word is getting around. If you know someone who is into Mac Development or iPhone Development, please do tell them about this initiative and website.

Oh, before I forget it. Stefanie Höfling from [The Big Nerd Ranch Europe][5] was kind enough to supply us with a Coupon Code which gives you an additional 50€ reduction on one of their courses. She even promised she would double that reduction for member of the CocoaHeads Belgium community. So, I&#8217;d like to thank here in the name of everyone involved in CocoaHeads Belgium.

For those of you who couldn&#8217;t make it to this month&#8217;s meeting, but would still like to get that discount, Stefanie provided me with a few additional cards / coupon codes. Make sure to ask me about the Coupon&#8217;s during next month&#8217;s meeting.

If anyone thinks he can help us out with one of the ideas mentioned in this topic, please do contact us. If you still have more ideas &#8230; well contact us as well. There is a real need for a CocoaHeads Belgium, and I&#8217;m sure that we can make it happen if we all work on it together.

Regards,

Stefaan
