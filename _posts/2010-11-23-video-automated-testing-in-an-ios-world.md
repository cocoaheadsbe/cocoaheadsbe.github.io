#### Video finally Online

Well, last month [Eric Bariaux][1] gave a presentation on Automated Testing in an iOS World during our Cocoaheads Belgium Meeting. I did video tape the session, but didn&#8217;t really find the time to process it yet &#8230; until then end of last week.

So I finally Imported the HDV Tapes, did some color correction, added a few titles, exported the whole thing &#8230; and ended up with a 90 GB file. I had to compress this into a smaller format for uploading and ended up with an 700 something Mb file which I uploaded to Vimeo.

##### Audio Quality

I know the audio quality isn&#8217;t superb &#8230; We did have a lot of noise from the activity in the room next to ours, and I couldn&#8217;t really filter that out without messing up the rest of the audio. Next time I&#8217;ll try to bring an Audio Interface and a Microphone so we can record the audio separately.

##### High Quality Version

The file I uploaded had a resolution of about 640 x 360 pixels, which is perfect for displaying on an older iPhone / iPod Touch, but somehow low quality for viewing on the iPad. If people are interested in a higher quality version, I could generate an iPad specific version for you, but I won&#8217;t be able to upload that to Vimeo due to the file size.

#### Next Meeting

Well, since we should have had this months meeting yesterday &#8230; we will be skipping it and try to organize the next one on the 20 th December (if that&#8217;s find with everyone). We are still looking for a location or a topic, but we could also make it a &#8216;coding&#8217; session if we can&#8217;t find someone to give a presentation.

#### Final Note

If anyone thinks he can help us out with one of the ideas mentioned in this topic, please do contact us. If you still have more ideas &#8230; well contact us as well., or even better &#8230; start organizing <img src="http://cocoaheads.be/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
