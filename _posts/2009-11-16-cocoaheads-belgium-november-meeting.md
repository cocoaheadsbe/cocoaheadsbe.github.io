The November meeting will take place in Nijvel on monday the 23 rd of November. Thanks to Eric Bariaux we will be able to use the venue at [TInSys][1]. The office is in the building of Solvay Entrepreneurs. Rue de l&#8217;industrie, 20 &#8211; 1400 Nivelles. 

This meeting is a great opportunity to meet up with other Cocoa Heads BE enthousiasts. The schedule for this meeting looks as follows :

  * 08:00 PM : As requested during the previous meeting, we have moved the starting time to 8 PM in order for everyone to get here.
  * 08:15 PM : Cytil Godefroy has prepared a session on the CLANG static ananlyzer, how it is integrated in XCode and how you can benefit from it. He will also talk a little about some &#8216;Gotchas&#8217; when using the CLANG static analyzer
  * 09:00 PM : We will be using the remaining time to get to know eachoter as quite a few members of the community have suggested. Everyone will get a few minutes to present who they are, what they do, if they are Mac or iPhone developers, what apps they have created and what they expect from CocoaHeads Belgium.

You can find more information on CocoaHeads Belgium a the CocoaHeads Belgium website, in the CocoaHeads Google Groups and I even created a Linked In group for CocoaHeads Belgium.

Registration for the November Meeting can be done on the [Eventbrite page][2]. If you have suggestions for future sessions or are willing to give a session, that would be the perfect time to let us know. 

Regards,
