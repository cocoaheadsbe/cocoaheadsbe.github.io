Functional-reactive programming, the buzzword of 2017. Are you already using it in your apps?
This talk will cover the basics of RxSwift, but also show how we use RxSwift in the nÂ° 1 public transport app in The Netherlands.

Presented by [Frederik Jacques](https://twitter.com/thenerd_be).

**Place and time**  
Binnenfort Fort 5  
Vestinglaan 55  
2650 Edegem  
8pm   

**Tickets**  
Please let us know if you are coming by reserving a ticket [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cocoaheads-belgium-november-2017-tickets-39585680837).

**Info**  
The fort is located in a park. There are two parking lots outside the park, a small one at the main entrance and a larger one at the side entrance near the church. See map. The park entrances close at 21:00, but you can get out at any time.

You can follow the "Bolwerk" signs to find the fort entrance. Once you're through the gate (photo), go right, then immediately left, take the stairs up and go left again to enter the co-working space.
