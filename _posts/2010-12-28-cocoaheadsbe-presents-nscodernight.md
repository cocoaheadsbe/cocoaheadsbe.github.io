author: Jelle De Laender
excerpt: It has been mentioned a few times on previous Cocoaheads Belgium Meetings, and finally the idea is starting to shape up. The community took up the idea and we have a suggestion for a date and location for the first Belgian NSCoder Night.

I would like to introduce our first NSCoderNight.

A NSCoderNight is basically an event where developers come together, shows some cool stuff, request support for technical issues and talk about the newest Objective-C and Cocoa stuff&#8230;

The first NSCoderNight will be in Ghent (in the neighborhood of  Ghent Dampoort station) and will be at Thursday February the 24th 2011  and start around 20:30.

I can get a location with a bar, WiFi-internet, some places to sit and power! What else do we need, except developers?

Are you interested and do you want to join the first NSCoderNight of CocoaHeadsBE? If so, please register at <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/1153188217" target="_blank">here</a>, so we can arrange enough seats and tables.
