I&#8217;m actually quite proud to announce that Roving Bird launches it&#8217;s first iOS developers training. The training is aimed to be a 3-day all inclusive starter training for Apple iOS (iPad, iPhone & iPod Touch) which will be held at Domein Martinus in Zoersel. The training is an All-inclusive training. The price for the training is set at 1.750 Euro (Excl. Taxes).

You might be wondering what is meant by an All-Inclusive training. Well the price includes food and lodging during the 3 days course at the Domein Marinus in Zoersel. 

If that&#8217;s not enough to convince you, we have been able to extend the early bird reduction for Cocoaheads Belgium members up till Jan 19 2011. 

**This means any Cocoaheads Belgium member, who registers prior to the 19th of January, will only pay 1.500 Euro (Excl. Taxes).**

Course will be held in English
