I found it hard to grasp the size and interface change of the iPad without using one. It&#8217;s a big thingie. So I made with my on tools a mockup and the way to design with paper and a pencil.

You can find my blog post here: <http://cyrilgodefroy.com/blog/index.php/2010/02/designing-for-the-ipad-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/>

I&#8217;ll think about taking the stuff for next meeting, if some of us want to try it out or see what it gives.
