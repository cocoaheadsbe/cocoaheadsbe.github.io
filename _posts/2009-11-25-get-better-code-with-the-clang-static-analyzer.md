Unfortunately, my screencast recording didn&#8217;t work too well on monday night. I played with the monitor once too much, I guess. But the slides are [here][1].

Please go to <http://github.com/cgodefroy/CLang-static-Analyzer-cases> for the source code of demos. I tried to add comments to explain a few things. If you have more code examples, fork it and send me a pull request (never tried it might be fun).

If you want more information on my iPhone app 321Run, please have a look at the [321Run website][2]. Feel free to play around with the application and show it to your friends (there is a free and apaid versions). Getting feedback from Belgian users would be great, so please go ahead, download the app and give it a spin. It is a nice app for beginners and regular runners. 

I am working on version 2.0 and am looking for some testers who would commit to run at least once a week for one month;-) Of course while using [321Run][2].

What else? Hopefully Stefaan will be able to put online the video he succeeded to record.
