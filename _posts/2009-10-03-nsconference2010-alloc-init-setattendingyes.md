Last year Steve Scott (Scotty from [The Mac Developer Network][1]) and Tim Isted hosted the NSConference 2009 on the 16th and 17th of April. The conference was aimed at Mac Developers and allowed them to spend 2 days together networking and educating themselves together with some of the World&#8217;s top Mac Developers.

Due to the success of last years NSConference2009, [NSConference 2010][2] will even be bigger and better. This year the conference will take place from the 31st of January till the 3rd of February 2010 in Wokefield Park, Redding, Berkshire, UK. The conference itself is intended to be a community event. To ensure that everyone gets a chance to meet everyone else, it has intentionally be kept relatively small (although 200 places isn&#8217;t that small IMHO).

The conference starts of with a one day optional workshop. Attendees have the choice between &#8216;The World According to Gemmell&#8217; by Matt Gemmell himself. The other option is &#8216;Concurrent Programming on Snow Leopard&#8217; by Drew McCormack. Matt will give us his views and opinions on the life cycle of Mac application development, while Drew will concentrate on technologies such as NSOperation, Grand Central Dispatch and OpenCL. It was a hard choice for me, but I choose to go with The Wold According to Gemmel.

The second an third day of the conference will include about 10 sessions and presentations from some of the worlds top Mac developers. Those sessions will primarily be aimed at intermediate to advanced Mac developers. Personally I&#8217;m still a novice when Mac development is concerned, but I&#8217;m absolutely positive I will pick up quite a few interesting things there.

The list of confirmed speakers is already impressive and apparently they still need to add some names to the list. Some of the names include : 

  * Aaron Hillegass : author of the [&#8220;Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X&#8221; book][3], which I would recommend to everyone starting out with Cocoa / Objective-C
  * Matt Legend Gemmel ; yes the guys who gave is the [MGTwitterEngine][4] and quite a few other goodies
  * Andy Finnel : specialized in Mac and iPhone development and a Core Image enthousiast
  * Drew McCormack : Board member and regular contributor on MacResearch.org 
  * Marcus Zarra : co-author of [&#8220;Cocoa is my Girlfriend&#8221;][5]
  * Mike Lee : Cofounder of Tapulous, whose titles include Tap Tap Revenge and Twinkle
  * &#8230;

And if 3 days isn&#8217;t enough, this year they have even added a fourth day, specially targeted at iPhone Developers. If iPhone development is your thing, then you&#8217;ll surely find something interesting in one of the 5 sessions from some of the worlds top iPhone developers.

Well, that was more than enough to get me convinced (and I noticed someone else from the CocoaHeads Belgium community already booked his tickets as well). If anyone from our community is interested in going as well, hurry up and book your tickets, and let us know here if you&#8217;re going. It would be great if we could have a small meet-up there as well <img src="http://cocoaheads.be/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
