#### What about CocoaHeads Belgium ?

CocoaHeads Belgium is the first Chapter of CocoaHeads in Belgium and our Founding Meeting will take place on monday 28 september 2009 starting at 19:00 in the offices of <a title="IBBT" href="http://www.ibbt.be/" target="_blank">IBBT</a> (Zuiderpoort Office Park, Gaston Crommenlaan 8, 9050 Gent-Ledeberg, Belgium).

This first meeting wil be an informal meeting in which attendees will have the opportunity to meet with other Cocoa and CocoaTouch enthousiasts from Belgium.

The goal of this meeting is to have a brainstorm session with the attendees.  This session will give everyone the opportunity to help us shape the future of CocoaHeads Belgium and make sure CocoaHeads Belgium will become THE event for Cocoa developers and by Cocoa developers.
