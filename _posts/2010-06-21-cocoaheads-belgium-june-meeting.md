CocoaHeads is a group devoted to discussion of Apple Computer&#8217;s Cocoa Framework for programming on MacOS X (including the iPhone). 

This month the meeting will take place in Brussels on the 28th of June. [Tom Maes][1] and the folks at [Sun Microsystems Belgium][2] have been kind enough to provide us with a location in which we can hold this month&#8217;s meeting. 

The address for this month&#8217;s meeting is Sun Microsystems Belgium, Lozenberg 15, 1932 Zaventem.

Tom will be presenting a session on &#8220;WWDC 2010 &#8211; The non-NDA parts&#8221;.

The meeting will start at 20:00, and there will be plenty of time to meet up with other Cocoa Heads BE enthousiasts. So if you&#8217;re interested, feel free to go to the EventBrite website and sign up, since spaces are limited.

You can find more information on CocoaHeads Belgium a the [CocoaHeads Belgium][3] website, in the [CocoaHeads Google Groups][4] and I even created a [Linked In group for CocoaHeads Belgium][5].

Registration for this Meeting can be done on the [Eventbrite page][6]. If you have suggestions for future sessions or are willing to give a session, that would be the perfect time to let us know.
