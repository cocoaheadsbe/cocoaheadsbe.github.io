CocoaHeads is a group devoted to discussion of Apple Computer&#8217;s Cocoa Framework for programming on MacOS X (including the iPhone).

This month the meeting will take place in Nivelles on the 25th of October.  Eric Bariaux (<a title="TInSys" href="http://tinsys.com/fr/Main.html" target="_blank">TInSys</a>) will be giving a session on Automated testing in an iOS world. As you can see, we have another interesting topic this month ! .
