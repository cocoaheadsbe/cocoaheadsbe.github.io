Before we start with the announcement, I would like to take the opportunity to thank everyone for being part of this community and wish you all the best for 2010 !

The first meeting of 2010 meeting will take place in Gent on monday the 25th of January. Thanks to Thomas Bouve and the people at [IBBT][1] we are able to use their offices again for this meeting. The offices of IBBT are located at Zuiderpoort Office Park, Gaston Crommenlaan 8 (bus 102), B-9050 Gent-Ledeberg. You can find the exact location on [Google Maps][2].

This meeting is a great opportunity to meet up with other Cocoa Heads BE enthousiasts. The schedule for this meeting looks as follows :

  * 08:00 PM : As requested during the previous meeting, we have moved the starting time to 8 PM in order for everyone to get here.
  * 08:15 PM : [Steven Vandeweghe][3] of [Blue Crowbar Software][4] has prepared a session on Core Image.
  * 09:00 PM : We will be using the remaining time to get to know eachoter as quite a few members of the community have suggested. Everyone will get a few minutes to present who they are, what they do, if they are Mac or iPhone developers, what apps they have created and what they expect from CocoaHeads Belgium.</div> 

You can find more information on CocoaHeads Belgium a the [CocoaHeads Belgium][5] website, in the [CocoaHeads Google Groups][6] and I even created a [Linked In group for CocoaHeads Belgium][7].

Registration for this Meeting can be done on the [Eventbrite page][8]. If you have suggestions for future sessions or are willing to give a session, that would be the perfect time to let us know. 

Regards, 

Stefaan Lesage
