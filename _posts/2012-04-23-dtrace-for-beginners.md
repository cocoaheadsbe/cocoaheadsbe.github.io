Hello all,

Koen Van Nieuwenhove (@CocoaCrumbs) will show us the basics of DTrace, the tool that&#8217;s behind Apple&#8217;s Instruments app.

The goal of the talk is to show what DTrace can do and thereby provide a better understanding of how Instruments works and how to interpret its output. The presentation will be at an introduction-level, consisting mostly of (live) examples to keep it as accessible as possible.

### Practical information:

  * **Date**: 26 April, 8pm
  * **Location**: Het Trappenhuis (School), Lucas Munichstraat 29, 9000 Gent
  * **Topic**: Koen Van Nieuwenhove will show us the basics of DTrace.
