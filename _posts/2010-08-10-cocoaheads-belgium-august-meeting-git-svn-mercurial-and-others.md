CocoaHeads is a group devoted to discussion of Apple Computer&#8217;s Cocoa Framework for programming on MacOS X (including the iPhone). 

This month the meeting will take place in Gent on the 23rd of August.  Steven Vandeweghe ([Blue Crowbar Software][1]) will be showing us how he uses Git as a Version Control System during his daily life as a developer.  We might also get some additional info on SVN by Eric Bariaux ([TinSys][2]) and Mercurial by Raphael Sebbe ([Creaceed][3]). As you can see, this promises to bring out some interesting discussions on Version Control Systems.

The location for this month&#8217;s meeting is in the offices of SHPArtners &#8211; [Roving Bird][4], Kortrijksesteenweg 1099a, 9051 Gent.

The meeting will start at 20:00, and there will be plenty of time to meet up with other Cocoa Heads BE enthousiasts. So if you&#8217;re interested, feel free to go to the EventBrite website and sign up, since spaces are limited.

You can find more information on CocoaHeads Belgium a the [CocoaHeads Belgium][5] website, in the [CocoaHeads Google Groups][6] and I even created a [Linked In group for CocoaHeads Belgium][7].

Registration for this Meeting can be done on the [Eventbrite page][8]. If you have suggestions for future sessions or are willing to give a session, that would be the perfect time to let us know.
