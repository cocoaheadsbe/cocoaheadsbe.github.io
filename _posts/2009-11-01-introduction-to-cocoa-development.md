title: Introduction to Cocoa development.
author: Stefaan Lesage
excerpt: Over the past few months, quite a few people have started to show interest in learning Cocoa development. Most of these people are not traditional Mac developers, but the success of the iPhone has captured their imagination. “Oh it’d be cool if I could write something that could do … and I could always have with me”.

> 
> Well, good news for those that want to get started: I’ll be giving a 4-part introduction to Cocoa development in november and december, in cooperation with Zeus, the computer science workgroup at Ghent University. The sessions will be held in the S9 building of the Sterre campus of Ghent University, Belgium and will probably be in Dutch (though English is also an option if someone turns up that doesn’t understand Dutch).
> 
> The best of all? This introduction is – in true Zeus spirit – completely free!
> 
> The dates and topics for the 4 sessions (which start at 8pm) are:
> 
>   * 05/11/2009: Objective-C, memory management and the Foundation framework
>   * 19/11/2009: Simple applications using AppKit and Interface Builder
>   * 03/12/2009: Cocoa tricks (key-value coding, animations,…)
>   * 10/12/2009: iPhone development
> 
> The goal of these sessions is not to give a complete Cocoa course, but rather to get you started, because the only way to really learn something is by actually doing it. So come and have a listen, try things out at home and bring your questions to the next session!
> 
> Hope to see you there!

Now this is quite interesting. It&#8217;s in Gent, so I might go over there on thursday to check it out myself !!
