According to us, the perfect recipe for a CocoaHeads meetup. Like every year, Apple will share all about their new technologies during the WWDC keynote, which weâ€™ll be watching on a big screen.  

To watch this livestream in style, we are treating you all to BBQ, burgers and beer!  

Curious to see what Apple has in store for us this year? Then join us for this CocoaHeads at [iCapps](https://www.icapps.com/) in Antwerp on June 5th at 6pm, in a beautiful location right next to the Schelde.
