We have two presentations this month, something general and something technical.  
Many thanks to Digiti, who generously provide the venue (plus sandwiches and drinks!) and to Bert and Tom for preparing a talk about some interesting stuff!

**Bert Timmermans — Mobile UX**  
Translating your idea into a great iOS app is not always that easy. In my presentation I will give you some practical tips on how to make this a bit easier and to help you get the most out of your apps.

**Tom Adriaenssen — Adventures in Multithreaded Core Data**

Parking space is available at the carpool parking at 50m from the Digiti offices.
