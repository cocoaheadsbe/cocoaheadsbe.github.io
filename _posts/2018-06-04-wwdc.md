According to us, the perfect recipe for a CocoaHeads meetup. Like every year, Apple will share all about their new technologies during the WWDC keynote, which weâ€™ll be watching on a big screen.  

Fancy an evening of tech talk, food and drinks? Then join us for this CocoaHeads at [iCapps](https://www.icapps.com/) in Antwerp on Monday June 4th at 6pm, in a beautiful location right next to the Schelde. For techies, by techies!

- Doors 18:00
- Keynote 19:00
